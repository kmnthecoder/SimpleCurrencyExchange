A currency exchange Android app. Uses MVVM architecture.

# Lessons learned / Final thoughts

A project undertaken in order to learn more about the MVVM architecture, and Android app programming in general.

Concepts used in the making of this app:
- Android design guidelines
- Using resources in the form of XML
- MVVM architecture
- SQL, Room Database
- RecyclerView, List Adapters, View Holders

This app only has hard-coded currencies and their respective values. Most of the currency exchange APIs on the web require a monthly paid membership. Seeing as this is just a learning project, I decided it wasn't worth it to pay for a monthly membership. There are also some small bugs and weird behaviours with the app when moving the order of them, and adding another currency to the list does not work. However, there are over 150+ flag icons included in this app, all of them circular and sized correctly.
